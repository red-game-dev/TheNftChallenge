# Graph Protocol + Aclhemy using Azreal NFT's

The project kept simple as possible as for the purpose being utilized for. In this case, didn't go too much in depth, but is enough to show the knowledge of using them. We must remember at the end of the day all these protocols their libraries tend to be very similar to one another, and knowing all possible libraries out there would be certainly impossible. Although knowing and understanding blockchain should be the key such as consensus, vector attacks and such, as from that you will be able to build bigger stuff, the rest is documentation.
